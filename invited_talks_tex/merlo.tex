\begin{abstract}
In the  computational study  of intelligent  behaviour, the  domain of
language is distinguished by the complexity of the representations and
the vast amounts  of quantitative text-driven  data. In this talk,  I will
let these two  aspects of the study of language  inform each other and
will  discuss  current  work   investigating  whether  the  notion  of
similarity  in  the intervention  theory  of  locality is  related  to
current notions of similarity in word embedding space.

Despite   their  practical   success   and  impressive   performances,
neural-network-based and  distributed semantics techniques  have often
been criticized as  they remain fundamentally opaque  and difficult to
interpret.   Several  recent  pieces  of work  have  investigated  the
linguistic abilities of these representations, and shown that they can
capture long agreement  and thus hierarchical notions.   In this vein,
we  study another  core,  defining and  more  challenging property  of
language:  the ability  to  construe  long-distance dependencies.   We
present  results that  show that  word embeddings  and the  similarity
spaces  they define  do  not correlate  with  experimental results  on
intervention similarity  in long-distance dependencies.  These results
show that the linguistic  encoding in distributed representations does
not appear to be human-like, and it also brings evidence to the debate
on narrow  or broad definitions  of similarity in syntax  and sentence
      processing.
