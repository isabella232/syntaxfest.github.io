### Paper submission information

#### Submission page
Papers must be submitted in PDF format exclusively through the SyntaxFest 
[joint submission page](
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=syntaxfest2021)


#### Paper length
We invite two types of submissions: long papers and short papers.
- Long papers may consist of up to 10 pages of content (excluding references);
- Short papers may consist of up to 6 pages of content (excluding references).

#### Style guidelines
All submissions should follow the common SyntaxFest 2021 stylesheet (based on the one-column COLING 2020 style guidelines). Stylesheets are provided as LaTeX style file and Microsoft Word templates (templates might be subject to slight modifications for compatibility reasons). The files are downloadable from [Depling site](https://depling.org/depling2021/). See section _Style guidelines_.

#### Double-blind reviews

Reviewing of papers will be double-blind. Therefore, the paper must not include the authors' names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that reveal the author's identity, e.g., "We previously showed (Zeng, 2018) ...", must be avoided. Instead, use citations such as "Zeng (2018) previously showed ...". Papers that do not conform to these requirements will be rejected without review.

#### Proceedings
For the authors’s convenience, despite the conference being held in March 2022, the Proceedings of Depling 2021 will be published in December 2021 in the ACL Anthology.

### Shared reviewing process

On the [submission site](
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=syntaxfest2021), authors submit their paper only once for the whole SyntaxFest, composed of 4 conferences, but they can uncheck conferences they do not wish their paper to be considered for. If the paper is deemed appropriate for more than one of the selected conferences, the SyntaxFest joint organization committee decides on the final placement of the paper, which implies the day of the presentation and the proceedings the paper will appear in.
