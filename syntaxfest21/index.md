### Shared reviewing process

On the [submission site](
https://easychair.org/account/signin?l=VPFgF6PmIlLQNqOKTkIMtL#), authors submit their paper only once for the whole SyntaxFest, composed of 4 conferences, but they can uncheck conferences they do not wish their paper to be considered for. If the paper is deemed appropriate for more than one of the selected conferences, the SyntaxFest joint organization committee decides on the final placement of the paper, which implies the day of the presentation and the proceedings the paper will appear in.
